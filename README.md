Salary Prediction using Linear Regression
Project Overview

This project predicts an employee’s salary based on years of experience using Simple Linear Regression.
It is one of the fundamental Machine Learning projects, demonstrating how to train, evaluate, and visualize a regression model using real-world data.

Key Objectives

Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset

Build a Linear Regression model using scikit-learn

Visualize relationships between experience and salary

Evaluate the model using regression metrics (MAE, MSE, R²)

Predict salaries for new experience values

Dataset

The dataset used is the Salary vs Experience dataset.
It contains two columns:

YearsExperience — Independent variable (X)

Salary — Dependent variable (y)

Example:

YearsExperience	Salary
1.1	39343.00
2.0	46205.00
3.2	60150.00
  
Technologies Used

Python 

Pandas — Data manipulation

NumPy — Numerical computations

Matplotlib / Seaborn — Visualization

Scikit-learn — Machine Learning (Linear Regression, Evaluation)

Steps Followed

Importing Libraries

Loading and Inspecting Dataset

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Scatter plots

Correlation heatmaps

Distribution plots

Model Building

Train-Test Split

Model Training using LinearRegression()

Evaluation Metrics

Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

R² Score

Predictions

Predict salaries for test data

Predict salary for a given number of years of experience

Model Formula

The trained model follows the equation:

Salary = (Coefficient × YearsExperience) + Intercept

Future Improvements

Deploy the model using Streamlit for interactive salary prediction

Add more features (e.g., education level, location)

Try multiple regression models and compare performance
